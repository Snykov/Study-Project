# Getting started
- Clone the repository
```
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Node-Starter.git <project_name>
```
- Install dependencies
```
cd <project_name>
npm install
```
- Configure your mongoDB server
```bash
# create the db directory
sudo mkdir -p /data/db
# give the db correct read/write permissions
sudo chmod 777 /data/db

# starting from macOS 10.15 even the admin cannot create directory at root
# so lets create the db directory under the home directory.
mkdir -p ~/data/db
# user account has automatically read and write permissions for ~/data/db.
```
- Start your mongoDB server (you'll probably want another command prompt)
```bash
mongod

# on macOS 10.15 or above the db directory is under home directory
mongod --dbpath ~/data/db
```
- Build and run the project
```
npm run build
npm start
```
Or, if you're using VS Code, you can use `cmd + shift + b` to run the default build task (which is mapped to `npm run build`), and then you can use the command palette (`cmd + shift + p`) and select `Tasks: Run Task` > `npm: start` to run `npm start` for you.

> **Note on editors!** - TypeScript has great support in [every editor](http://www.typescriptlang.org/index.html#download-links), but this project has been pre-configured for use with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Throughout the README We will try to call out specific places where VS Code really shines or where this project has been set up to take advantage of specific features.

Finally, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and you should see the template being served and rendered locally!
